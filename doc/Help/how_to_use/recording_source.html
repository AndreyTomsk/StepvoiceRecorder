		<dt>Stepvoice Recorder uses a default sound device for audio recording. You
		can change it by opening the system audio properties
		dialog with the recorder menu:</dt>
		<dd><strong>Options <img src="../images/arrow.png"> Sound Devices...</strong></dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Generally a sound card has several recording lines: microphone, line input,
		etc. To change a current line press the <em>&quot;Mixer Line Selection&quot;</em>
		button:</dt>
		<dd><img src="../images/button_mixerline.png"></dd>
	</dl>
	<p>To record any sounds, currently playing on your computer, select the <em>StereoMix</em>
	line. This line is supported by most sound cards, but could have another name:
	<em>What U Hear, Output, Mixer, Wave.</em></p>
	
	<p>A lot of new computers running Windows Vista have a microphone line only. Try this
	solution to activate the StereoMix line: open the system audio properties dialog (see
	above), go to the Recording tab, right click in an empty area, and choose
	<em>&quot;Show Disabled Devices&quot;</em>. Now, right click the stereo mix and choose
	<em>&quot;Set as standard&quot;</em>.</p>
	
	<p>The Stepvoice Recorder also provides the <em>&quot;What U Hear (Software)&quot;</em>
	virtual line for loopback recording.</p>
